# Introduction


A collection of `Unreal Engine learning resources`, crafted by the **Vis [Staff](https://www.vis-foundation.com) & [Community](https://discord.gg/tFsZScdWKT)**! 
     
We hope this is useful to you! 

## What's in here?

Lots of stuff! We'll be adding new projects as we create them, or as developers like you add them!
  
We work within a main "Working" project, and then split out features into more specific projects to keep downloads small. If you want to contribute, find out how below!

## How can I contribute?

If you want to give back, consider contributing with your own code! You can also [buy the staff a coffee](https://commerce.coinbase.com/checkout/069ed86f-046a-4ae3-b94a-9214f58777d7) :) 
   
For now, to submit code to the repository, get in contact with mods in the [Community](https://discord.gg/tFsZScdWKT). In the future we'll work soley with pull requests. Everything that you submit here will be under the [MIT liscense](https://github.com/Visualistic-Studios/LearningVault/blob/main/LICENSE)
